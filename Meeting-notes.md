* Miku's study is getting to real world testing phase, that is testing their model's performance on the field - subdistricts, centres for care etc.

* Context - A lot of people don't complete their treatment for TB due to multiple factors, which increases their risk of developing life threatening conditions (with drug resistant variants), and higher risk of transmitting infection to others

* Problem statement: Identify the people to whom advanced interventions will yield the highest recall. People have been put into multiple buckets based on their treatment and their response to the treatment

* Currently, advanced interventions are provided based on personal experience of the caregivers and other stakeholders involved which has a low recall rate of 20%, since on average a given subunit care center only has resources to provide care to 20% of the population. But with the model Miku and his team have been working on, they're receiving recall rate of 50% and above, which is a significant improvement on the status quo. Also, they're doing this as a projective study, that is training on data till time t and testing it on t+1. Even there, it's shown promise, and so they're planning to now actually run field studies

* Jay's unnecessary superlong work meetings. Need to give more time at his own home

* Meeting plans for Mumbai meetup of Junta
